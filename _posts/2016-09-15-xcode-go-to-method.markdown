I’m always amazed when I see someone moving around a file significantly faster than I thought possible. 

The other day, I saw a co-worker hit a couple of keys and jump to a specific method in a ~500 line file. I knew Xcode had a toolbar for this task, but he did it so much faster than I ever could.

I normally use vim in my editors, so if I happen to know the exact name of a method, I’m there just as quickly. Unfortunately, the chances of that happening are pretty slim. 

Fortunately, my co-worked told me about the ^6 (Control-6) shortcut. Hit those keys, and you can fuzzy-search your way towards a method.

It’s a small, quick tip, but I use that toolbar _all the time_. Any efficiency is welcome!
