Hello and welcome to my blog! I've thought about blogging dozens of times, but I never put the work in. Today I did.

What prompted this? Well, I became stuck with my list of personal and professional goals. Instead of rushing to try to complete them all, I reflected on what I really wanted to achieve. I also stumbled across a quote from the famous astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson:

> "For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you." 

This quote made me realize that the goals I set all distill down to two tasks: learn more stuff and help more people.

Yeah, I'll admit, that's pretty broad. 

In order to be slightly more actionable, those tasks created a new, singular goal: every day, learn something and write about it. That's exactly what I'll be doing here. 

Instead of occasionally thinking about goals that are weeks, months, or years away, I'm going to be __doing__ something every single day. Hopefully, I'll look back in three months and realize that all the goals I originally set were accomplished by my actions. If that doesn't work out, I'll start down another path.

Now, you might be wondering why you'd follow along. That's a good question. I'm not going to lie, the main reason I'm blogging is to keep myself accountable. 

But don't leave just yet! Considering I'm trying to learn things, I might hit a topic that you care about. The main areas I'm looking to cover are: software engineering (specifically iOS, .Net, and web), deveops / infrastructure engineering, and management. I might write about additional topics occasionally (cooking, bikes, boardgames, tabletop RPGs, etc.), but those will be reserved for days when I either don't have a good main topic or learned so much that I post multiple times.

For today: I'm going to consider setting up a [Jekyll][jekyll] blog a learning experience. I was hoping to go into a little more detail, but, honestly, it was a lot of copy and paste. Also, I didn't keep any of the resources I used around. Hey, I've got to start somewhere.

I'm currently working through [Functional Swift][functional-swift], so I hope to have something a little more interesting to share tomorrow. Seeya then!
